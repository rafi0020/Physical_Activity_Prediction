## üöÄ Methodology

### Machine Learning Models
1. **Logistic Regression**:
   - Simple and interpretable model.
   - Accuracy: 69.44%.
2. **Decision Tree**:
   - Captures non-linear relationships and feature importance.
   - Accuracy: 77.48%.
3. **Random Forest**:
   - Combines multiple decision trees for robustness.
   - Accuracy: 78.02%.

### Workflow:
1. Preprocessed the dataset for quality and consistency.
2. Split the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) subsets.
3. Trained models using k-fold cross-validation.
4. Evaluated performance on the test set using confusion matrices and other metrics.
